download 9bi6.pdb from RCSB

put  sequences of four domains with Uniprot IDs Q15743, P50148, P62873 and P59768 into the complex_seq.txt in the fasta format, and make chain IDs of these sequences same as the domains in 9bi6.pdb. The lines contain the chain IDs have to in this format: > + chain ID, for example ">A".  The sequece length should be edit based on your need.

put  AlphaFold2 predicted structures (downloads from Uniprot according to the IDs above) of four domains  into the template.pdb

the file wats_inhole_del_2.pdb is the waters in the inner pocket of the transmembrance domain, it can be generated by set -w_inh with 1 in the first time of building. This file can be reused in the following system building for homo proteins.
